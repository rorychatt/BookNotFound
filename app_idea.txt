I want to build an app with following features:

- Store documentation as markdown files on the backend
- Allow users to submit questions based on the documentation
- Certainty score for ai results based on user feedback, positive or negative, with users actually editing 

Backend features:

- python library running a LLM locally, supporting open ai api (but I want to run locally)
- reads existing markdowns, updates them based on feedback, creates new markdowns for given topics
- vector database for storing ai results that adapts over time.
- a feature where we can call a function that proposes what changes need to be made to the documentation files based on user submitted feedback and the values stored in vector base

All FE and BE features must be run locally.

For frontend, use angular 19
